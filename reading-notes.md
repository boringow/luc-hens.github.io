Book is in personal library (VUB office).[Compare to the CEPR paper by De Grauwe, Feb. 2000 (exact referencestill to look up)][Abstract: still to complete]135  1. Introduction2. Central Banking and asymmetries of shocks 136   "The ECB, which is responsible for maintaining price stability and for stabilising the economy in Euroland as a whole [emphasis in original] aggregates the numbers. "  (pp. 135-6) " - Compares ECB’s reaction to (pure) asymmetric shock and to symmetricshock in Phillips-curve diagrams. Base of comparison: each central bank setsoptimal policy (Barro-Gordon model, see appendix) (cf. section 3). " 137   - Conclusion:  "To the extent thatthere is some asymmetric component in the shocks, the ECB will always stabilisetoo little from the point of view of the individual member state. " Thisproblem of insufficient stabilisation cannot be resolved (theory of optimumcurrency areas). Hence,  "There will (...) be a lot of conflict betweenmember-states and the ECB. " (138).138   - How important will these asymmetricshocks be in the future?  "There is some empirical evidence (...) that asEuroland integrates more an increasing amount of shocks are likely to beregional [sub-national] or border-overlapping. [See however Braunerhjelm et al.(2000) for a less optimistic view.] As a result, the problem the ECB will facemay not be very different from the problem any central bank of a country (thatis not too small) faces when regional shocks occur. [cf. paper Vanhoudt andBuyst on Belgium in same volume] Such a central bank is equally incapable ofusing its monetary policy to deal with a regional problem. - But: "  (1) nation-states may react stronger than regions;   (2) nation-states may cause shock of political or socialorigin, and look at ECB as scapegoat [refers to fiscal shocks or wage shocks??] " (3)  "(...) the existence of different nations with theirown legal and cultural systems leads to different transmission mechanisms ofthe policies of the ECB (...) " [section 4] "139   **3. EMU versus EMS** " - Compares how ECB reacts to (pure) asymmetric shock and to symmetric shockin Phillips-curve diagrams. Base of comparison: Bundesbank sets monetary policyfor all EMS countries (cf. section 2). With a pure asymmetric shock, onecountry does better in EMU than in EMS, one worse. " 141   **4. Asymmetries in the transmission**and optimal monetary policies** " - due to different structures and institutions [refers to recent researchfor Euroland by Ceccchetti (1999) and MacLennan et al. (1999), NOT INCLUDED INREFERENCES _ CHECK] " - illustrates differences in transmission of monetary policy following asymmetric shock in a country with flexible labour markets (flat SP curve in(p,u)-space) and one with rigid labour markets (steep SP curve). Euro-wide SPcurve has slope that is average of individual SP curves. "142   - results: "  - in flexible country: stabilisation by ECB is effectivein limiting the increase in unemployment. "  - in rigid country: stabilisation ineffective "  - can the ECB do better? yes, if it uses nationalinformation (section 5) " 142   **5. Should the ECB use national information?** " - ECB uses euro-wide aggregates:  "The ECB has decided to formulate itsmonetary policies by taking into consideration euro-wide aggregates ofmacroeconomic variables such as inflation, unemployment and inflation [sic],and thus by disregarding national information concerning theses macroeconomicvariables. This decision can be defended on the ground that the ECB mustrepresent the interests of Euroland as a whole, [p. 143 starts here] and not ofparticular countries. The decision seems totally legitimate. Yet under certainconditions it can lead to problems in that the welfare of all countries isreduced relative to a situation where the ECB would take national informationinto account when formulating its optimal policies." 143   Set-up same as in section 4 (Fig. 8 p. 144). [include fig. 8 p. 144 in paper and use for presentation - maketransparency with colour overlays]  - The resulting policies are sub-optimal:  "Bothcountries [Rigid and Flexible] would prefer less expansionary monetary policiesthan the one the ECB is applying [on basis of an  "average " SP curveand corresponding optimal stabilisation line] as a response to the shock [arightward shift of SP increasing u]. Put differently, both countries considerthe ECB response to the shock as excessively inflationary. " "  "The optimal policy derived by the ECB is not an average of theinflation rates that the two countries (with the same preferences as the ECB)find optimal. The ECB could do better by taking the average of the optimalinflation rates derived directly from the national Phillips curves. This wouldbe a Pareto-improvement for both countries. " 144   "If there are important differences in the transmission process of the same shocks, it is not desirable that the ECB uses an aggregate euro-model of the economy to derive  its optimal monetary policy. With large asymmetries in the transmission process theeuro-model approach creates important aggregation biases and leads to sub-optimal policies. " " - Policy implication: the ECB should use national variables. Proposesprocedure: ECB board uses euro-model to set optimal policy. Each nationalgovernor does same using national variables. Confront national policies withECB board policy. If consensus, use ECB board policy. If not, take average ofnational policies.  145   **6. The Monetary Policy Strategy of the ECB: a description** 147   **7. The Monetary Policy Strategy of the ECB: an evaluation**          7.1. The selection of the target 148     7.2. Is the inflation target of atmost 2% too low? 150      7.3. Excessive reliance on the money stock? 151      7.4. Inflation targeting: a model for the ECB? 152   **Conclusion** " [summarizes the paper] 153   **Appendix: The optimal stabilisation path in the Barro-Gordon model**   - Central Bank minimises quadratic loss function: inflation target = 0  unemployment target is below natural rate;  - subject to short-term Phillips curve; " 154   - yields expression for optimalinflation (function of expected inflation, natural rate of unemployment, randomshock); - assume rational expectations: agents use expression for optimal inflationand use it to set their expectations; solving for expected inflation yields       p^e  = ab(1- l)u^N  "... in equilibrium the average [that is, expected] inflation ispositive reflecting an inflation bias. " [result of setting unemploymenttarget below natural rate, 0 < l < 1] "  -  "(...) central bank sets the inflation rate so asto reduce the variance of unemployment. ": "  - yields expression for inflation rate: [unclear howthis result is obtained _check later in Scarth or Romer] "     p =  "p^e +(constant)(random shock) (7) "  - substituted into Phillips curve yields expression foru:  u = u^N + (constant)(random shock) (8)155   - optimal stabilisation path: centralbank sets inflation rate optimally in response to unanticipated shocks inunemployment (p. 135):  find expressions for dp/de [reaction function] and  du/de ;  divide dp/de by du/de to obtain slope of optimal stabilisation line: dp/du = ab. ```
