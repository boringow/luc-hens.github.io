# Recommendation 

### What you can expect from me:
A letter of recommendation is an honest assesment of a student's or graduate's abilities. Typically, a referee has to report how long and in which capacity they have known the applicant, what the applicant's main strenghts and weaknesses are, and whether the applicant is suitable for the program. The referee also has to rank the applicant relative to a peer group (for instance, fellow undergraduates or graduates at the VUB) for a number of criteria (intellectual & academic capacity, capacity for fluent and logical oral and written communication, proficiency in English, the ability to work hard, perseverance, creativity, leadership, ability to work with others, and social skills). The referee usually has to rank the student in percentiles (top 5%, top 10%, top 25%, top 40%, average, below average). 

I usually put "don't know" for "leadership" and "ability to work with others" because I can't observe these skills, unless you served as a student representative in the curriculum committee (*opleidingsraad*). For the other criteria, I'm honest in my assessment: if you were below average in my classes or if your GPA was below average compared to other graduates of your graduating class, I will write so in my letter of recommendation. In such cases, in is better not to ask me for a recommendation. 

 If you just took one class with me and didn't write a bachelor paper or master's thesis with me, my assessment is based on little information. This will be clear to the selection committee from my answer to the question "how long and in which capacity have you known the applicant?", and the selection commmittee will give little weight to the recommendation. In such cases, it is also better not to ask me for a recommendation. 

 I only provide recommendation letters for specific applications (e.g., for a specific job, internship, graduate program). I don't provide general-purpose recommendation letters ('to whom it may concern').

Allow two weeks to get a reply (and more if you didn't provide me with all the information requested, see below). I get many requests for recommendation letters, often clustered in a short period of time. Don't send requests less than two weeks before the deadline.  

### What I expect from you:
If you want to request a letter of recommendation, send me an email (luc.hens@vub.be) with in the subject line <code>request for recommendation</code> and in the body of the mail (unless specified otherwise) the following information:
1. Your name (first name first)
2. Your degree (bachelor, master, PhD), major and --if applicable-- your concentration or minor
3. The month and year you graduated or expect to graduate (e.g., May 2022)
4. A list of all the courses you took with me, the academic year when you took them, and the grades you obtained (e.g., Economics for Business, 2020-2021, 16/20)
5. Your cumulative grade point average at graduation, your honors (cum laude, magna cum laude, summa cum laude), or, if you haven't graduated yet, your current cumulative grade point average. 
6. The exact name of the program you are applying for, including the name of the university;
7. A short description of the program you are applying for (from the program brochure or the program web site);
8. The name and (mail) address of the admissions officer to whom I should send the recommendation;
9. The due date for the recommendation and application;
10. A personal statement motivating why you are applying for the program (150 words);

Attach the following documents to your mail (as pdf files):			
1. Your CV;
2. Your university diplomas, university diploma supplements or university transcripts. Do not send secondary school diplomas; 
3. Some graded written work (such as a research paper or a term paper) you did for my courses or for other courses; your bachelor thesis or master's thesis;
4. (if applicable) The recommendation form as a word processor document when available, as a pdf file otherwise.

Don't send documents other than those specified in above. Send documents in pdf, not in any other format (except for the recommendation form when it is provided as a word processor document to be filled in by the referee).

Letters of recommendation are **confidential and strictly personal**. If you have access to your letter of recommendation, you are not allowed to share it with anyone other than the admissions officer in charge of your application.
